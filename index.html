                I think that creating this engine really helped solidify my understanding of the concepts of this course. Throughout this course, I have struggled with the psets due to not being able to grasp the concepts as well as
                a lack of creativity. I think that this style of learning by doing did help me in the end because it got me used to a more free rein style of programming. I'm not used to having a lot of freedom in my projects, and while
                it was a struggle at first, I ended up being very happy with my final product. I feel like my code is very organized, and the communication between different components, while still coupled, feels intuitive.
