                I think that creating this engine really helped solidify my understanding of the concepts of this course. Throughout this course, I have struggled with the psets due to not being able to grasp the concepts as well as
                a lack of creativity. I think that this style of learning by doing did help me in the end because it got me used to a more free rein style of programming. I'm not used to having a lot of freedom in my projects, and while
                it was a struggle at first, I ended up being very happy with my final product. I feel like my code is very organized, and the communication between different components, while still coupled, feels intuitive. If I had more time,
                I think I would focus it on adding more mechanics and a bigger wow factor, and making scripts interpreted. While I'm happy with my project, I do feel like it leaves something to be desired, and if I had more time, I would definitely spend it
                adding more features, both visually and engineering-wise. I also would have liked to write my scripts in an interpreted language like Lua or Python. I think it's much more intuitive for the user to be able to see what is changing
                in the engine as it's being edited, and it's a feature I would have loved to add.
